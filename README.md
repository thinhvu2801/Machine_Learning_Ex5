## Introduction

This repository is part of the coursework for **Machine Learning**. Exercise 5 focuses on practical implementation of machine learning concepts, such as data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Features
- Implementation of key machine learning models.
- Preprocessing datasets for training and evaluation.
- Example of hyperparameter tuning and optimization.
- Evaluation metrics for performance analysis.

## Prerequisites

To run the code, ensure you have the following:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Required Python libraries (see `requirements.txt` if available):
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `matplotlib`

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/thinhvu2801/Machine_Learning_Ex5.git
   cd Machine_Learning_Ex5
2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage

Run the main script to execute the exercis, you can modify configurations or experiment with different models by editing the scripts in the repository
   ```bash
    python main.py
```
